  <h1>Alberto Romero Calderon</h1>
  <p>My name is Alberto, I was born in Hidalgo, Mexico but raised in Anaheim, California. I am a third year BFA Photography major at San Jose State University. Being brought to the United States has definitely not been easy but nothing really is. Photography has always been something I enjoyed, but it wasn't until my first year in community college that I enrolled in a photography course and instantly fell in love with it. Being someone who is introverted I found a place where I can express myself with imagery rather than words. That being said, here you will see not only some of my past photography work but some digital media works in progress that I hope to someday integrate with my photography.
